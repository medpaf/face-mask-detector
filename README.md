# Face mask detector

Computer vision and machine learning application implemented in Python to detect masks in one or more faces.
Supports detection from static images and video streams from webcam.

The easiest way to use this program is to run the gui.py file (currently, only supported on UNIX systems). If you are using the Windows operating systems run the code (detect_mask_image.py or detect_mask_video.py) directly from the terminal.

The dependencies to run this script are:

  1) tensorflow
  2) keras
  3) opencv (cv2)
  4) skicit-learn (sklearn)
  5) matplotlib
  6) numpy
  7) imutils
  8) tkinter
  
To train the model, the gui.py file can be used or the following command can be issued on the terminal (inside the projectâ€™s root folder):
`python3 train_mask_detector.py --dataset dataset`

After issuing this command, the terminal will continuously prompt current information about the training process including accuracy, loss, number of epoch and
remaining time.

After the training process is done, inside the root folder, an image file will be created containing the performance metrics of the model. Also, some metrics like precision, recall f1-score and support will be displayed in the terminal.

To test the model using static images, apart from using the GUI, which is recommended since it makes the process fairly simple, the following command can be
issued in the terminal as an example:
`python3 detect_mask_image.py --image examples/ex1`

More images were then used to continue to test the model. The results of these tests are shown below.

After assuring that the detect_mask_image.py script is working properly, it is time to test the detect_mask_video.py script to see if it also preforms without issues. Once again, to do that the gui.py file can be used or the following command can be issued in the terminal:
`python3 detect_mask_video.py`
