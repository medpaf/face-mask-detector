# Face mask detector

Computer vision and machine learning application implemented in Python to detect masks in one or more faces.
Supports detection from static images and video streams from webcam.

The easiest way to use this program is to run the gui.py file (currently, only supported on UNIX systems). If you are using the Windows operating systems run the code (detect_mask_image.py or detect_mask_video.py) directly from the terminal.

The dependencies to run this script are:

  1) tensorflow
  2) keras
  3) opencv (cv2)
  4) skicit-learn (sklearn)
  5) matplotlib
  6) numpy
  7) imutils
  8) tkinter
